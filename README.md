# Car-Data-Analysis
# 🚗 Summer Analytics 2025 – Cars Dataset Assignment

Welcome to my first assignment of **Summer Analytics 2025**!  
This project involves exploring a dataset of car specifications and performing analysis using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains various attributes of 398 cars, such as:

- `mpg` (miles per gallon)
- `cylinders`
- `displacement`
- `horsepower`
- `weight`
- `acceleration`
- `model_year`
- `origin`
- `name` (car name)

📌 Objectives

This notebook is divided into 3 main parts:

🧰 1. Setup and Basic Exploration
- Import necessary libraries.
- Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
- View shape and column names.
- Set `name` as the DataFrame index.
- Create a derived metric: `horsepower / weight`.

📊 2. Graded Questions
- Find the car with the highest horsepower.
- Count how many cars have `mpg ≥ 35`.
- Determine the most common origin for cars with `horsepower > 100` and `weight < 3000`.
- Calculate mean acceleration for cars from Japan.
- Identify the year with the highest average `mpg`.

🔬 3. Ungraded Advanced Analysis
- **Best horsepower-to-weight ratio**: Among cars with above-median `mpg`.
- **Multi-line plot**: Show evolution of average `mpg` per year grouped by origin.
- **Scatter plot**: `horsepower` vs `weight`, colored by origin, sized by `mpg`.
- **Consistent models**: Find car models produced over multiple years with low `mpg` variation.

🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

🚀 How to Run

1. Open Google Colab
2. Upload `Cars.csv` and this notebook.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.
4. View plots and answers in the output cells.

📈 Example Output

- Car with highest horsepower: pontiac grand prix
- Year with highest average mpg: 80
- Best horsepower-to-weight car (above median mpg): bmw 2002
